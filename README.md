# Analysis-of-Factors-Influencing-Business-Performance
 # Project Overview
In an increasingly competitive environment, businesses must understand the factors that influence the performance of their employees and commercial activities. This project aims to analyze the interactions between employee performance, profit margins, and regional performance to optimize business strategy.

 # Data Used
The dataset comes from a CSV file containing information on:

-	Employee characteristics (department, education level, satisfaction, etc.).
-	Employee performance (evaluations, number of projects managed, training hours, etc.).
-	Financial factors (salary, overtime, absences, etc.).
# Tools and Technologies
-	Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
-	Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory analysis

# Analysis Approach
-	Data Exploration: Visualization of distributions and missing values.
-	Bivariate Analysis:
-	Correlations between numerical variables (correlation matrix, heatmap).
-	Qualitative-quantitative comparisons (performance gaps by department and education level).
# Advanced Visualizations:
-	Scatter plots to identify relationships between numerical variables.
-	Boxplots to compare distributions by category.
 # Key Findings
-	Employees managing more projects and undergoing more training tend to perform better.
-	Employee satisfaction is negatively impacted by overtime and absences.
-	Salary disparities exist across different departments.
